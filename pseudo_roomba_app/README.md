# pseudo_roomba_app

A new Flutter project by Liam Webster.

## Goal

I want to try to create a pseudo Roomba vacuum machine. Using my previously built voice controlled car from UC Berkeley(Course: EECS 16b) as the base. I plan to modify the car with a Swiffer Sweeper attachment, Wifi Controller, and software implementation to interact with this Flutter app. 

[Roomba Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIPzSmwClJ8)

This Flutter App: 

- AR IOS app to floor plan the cleaning area. 
- Route is automatically generated via the floor plan.
  - The cleaning route is optimized via distance traveled minimization.
- Route is sent to the car via a Wifi network push.    
- Start/Stop/Resume/Pause functionality via Wifi network pushes.
