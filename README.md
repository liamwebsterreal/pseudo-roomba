# pseudo_roomba_app

## Goal

I want to try to create a pseudo Roomba vacuum machine. Using my previously built voice controlled car from UC Berkeley(Course: EECS 16b) as the base. I plan to modify the car with a Swiffer Sweeper attachment, Wifi Controller, and software implementation to interact with this Flutter app.

## Progress:

5/21/22 I have implemented the ARKit plugin. The app is able to add nodes which create lines between each other into the real world. I have added a reset and remove last node function.
